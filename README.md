# Understanding H-1B Labor Market Trends: How Interface Design Shapes Insight Discovery

## Abstract
This project investigates how different visualization modalities, specifically an interactive dashboard compared to static charts, shape users’ understanding of H-1B labor dynamics from 2020 to 2025. Using a large dataset of hundreds of thousands of certified Labor Condition Applications (LCAs), we conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed predictive models to investigate approval trends, wage distributions, occupational clusters and geographic patterns. We translated these analytical insights into an interactive visualization tool and compared it against static charts in a controlled A/B study. Participants using the interactive dashboard demonstrated meaningfully higher insight, engagement, trust and usability. These findings suggest that interactive visual analytics substantially enhance comprehension of complex immigration labor data. We conclude by identifying several avenues for future development, including scaling user studies, expanding predictive modeling and integrating policy-aware analytics.
